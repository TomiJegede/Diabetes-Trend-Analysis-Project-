# Diabetes Trend Analysis



This project analyzes diabetes trends using the diabetes dataset from Kaggle, sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases. The dataset focuses on diagnostic data among females of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 and above to predict diabetes occurrence.



## Project Overview



The primary objective of this project was to use the given dataset to analyze trends and predict the occurrence of diabetes. This involved thorough data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, and creating visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.

## Data Analysis



- **Data Cleaning:** 

  - Handled missing values and outliers.

  - Standardized data formats and ensured data consistency.



- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  - Investigated the distribution of variables.

  - Analyzed relationships between variables to uncover significant insights.



## Visualizations



- Created visualizations to effectively communicate the findings:

  - Histograms

  - Scatterplots

  - Boxplots

  - Correlation heatmaps



## Recommendations



Based on the analysis, several recommendations for future studies and analyses were made. These are detailed in the PowerPoint presentation.
